# vsc_quokka_statusbar

Adds buttons to the status bar in VSC to control Quokka:

- **"Q +"** Start Quokka on the current file
- **"Q -"** Stop Quokka from processing the current file
- **"Q --"** Stop Quokka from processing all files

The buttons when appear when a Javascript/Typescript file is opened. There are no configurations options at the moment as I can't see any need for them.
